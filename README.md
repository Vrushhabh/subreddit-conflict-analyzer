# subreddit-conflict-analyzer
* Hey this is my analysis of the SNAP Reddit data set which has a focus on the sentiment (whether the post is wellmeaning or not) of the post      [SNAP Reddit dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html)
* the main goal of this project is for me to learn a variety of tools and languages along with strengthening programming concepts I already know such as OOP, avoiding repetitiveness and data structures (since it's a network)
* Go to NotebookFindings to find the results and analysis I have done so far




readme will be updated soon to have some of the more interesting findings
